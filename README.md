# simpleApi
 Create a REST API that manages user data.

 This program is a basic Flask API that can add, view, update, and delete user details. 
 Instead of using a database, it stores the data in a Python list, so the data is lost when the server stops. 
 Each task is done using different API endpoints, and the results are sent back in JSON format.
